I have benn a front-end engineer for a while.During that time i learn a lot from my colleagus;They tought me something that i cant learn from
other.Doing the work that is relative to IT is a big challenge to me,after all i am not majoy in it.however i have strong passion on the computer,
especially on the webpage.I wonder how it was been build,how it works,the effects is great.then,i decide i must be a engineer that can diy my own 
webpage.Now it became trueth.

Javascript is a difficult language,too much knowlege i cant understand.besides that ,i alse need to learn Jquery,angular,vue,lalall......
